# Fertilizer Prediction – Playground Series S5E6

## Project Overview

This project predicts up to three optimal fertilizers for crops based on soil and environmental features. It uses the Kaggle Playground Series – Season 5, Episode 6: Predicting Optimal Fertilizers dataset. The end goal is to build a pipeline and API that can generate fertilizer recommendations, supporting precision agriculture and crop yield optimization.

## Dataset
- Kaggle competition: Playground Series S5E6
- The dataset is not included in this repo due to size and licensing.
- Place downloaded CSV files in the data/ folder before running scripts or notebooks.

## Usage
- EDA: Run notebooks in notebooks/eda.ipynb for initial data exploration.
- Modeling: Use scripts in src/ for preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- API: TBD (future deployment pipeline).
